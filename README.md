## 👋 Hello!

My name is Bruuno Paz, and I am a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. 🇵🇹

I am passionate about everything tech and I am eager to learn new things. I have a particular interest in everything related to Engineering practices, CI/CD, DevOps, automation, and more recently Web3 and decentralized Web.

The languages I am mostly familiar with are **Golang**, **PHP (Symfony Framework)** and **Javascript/NodeJS**. Also have some professional experience with **Java**. Want to get my hands dirty with **Rust** one day.

I strongly believe in tech and programming as a way to improve people's lives and that´s my main focus.
