## 👋 Hello!

My name is Bruuno Paz, and I am a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. 🇵🇹

I am eager to learn new things and I have a deep interest in everything related to the Software Devlopment Lifecycle like Engineering practices, Software Quality, CI/CD, DevOps and Automation.

The technologies I am mostly familiar with are **PHP**, **Symfony** and **Golang**. Also have some expeirnece with NodeJS and Java, but I believe in using whatever tech stack is more appropriate to get the job done.

I believe in tech and programming as a way to improve people lives and thsat people should always at the center of everything we do as Software Engineers.
