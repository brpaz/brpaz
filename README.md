## 👋 Hello!

My name is Bruuno Paz, and I am a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. 🇵🇹

I am on the field professionaly since 2011. Started in a small startup called **ueb**, and now working at [Jumia](https://group.jumia.com/).

I am eager to learn new things. Passionate about tech and programming in general, I have a deep interest in everything related to the Software Devlopment Lifecycle: Engineering practices, Software Quality, Development Processes, CI/CD, DevOps, Automation, etc.

The technologies I am mostly familiar with are **PHP**, **Symfony** and **Golang**. Professionally also working atm with Java and looking into Typescript.

I believe in tech and programming as a way to improve people lives. Tech isolated from the "real world" doesnt make much sense to me.
