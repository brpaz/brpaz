## 👋 About Me 

Hello!

My name is Bruuno Paz, and I am a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. 🇵🇹

My biggest passion is Web Development and I am on the field professionaly since 2011. Started in a small startup called **ueb**, where I had the opportunity to grow a lot, since there were only 5 devs building some very ambitious projects. Needed to grasp topics from Backend, Frontend, Git, Linux Servers etc very fast.

Then moved on to [Jumia](https://group.jumia.com/), where I am since 2014 and I have worked in many projects from [Jumia Travel](https://travel.jumia.com) to [JumiaPay](https://pay.jumia.com), using a wide range of technologies.

Have worked with PHP and Symfony for more than five years. Lately mostly Golang and some Java.

Despite my experience or preferences, I always try to keep up to date with other programming languages and frameworks so that I can keep improving my knowledge and skills. I believe in always choosing the best technology for the the job, even if we need to get out of our comfort zone.

I am eager to learn new things. Passionate about tech and programming in general, I have a deep interest in everything related to the Software Devlopment Lifecycle: Engineering practices, Software Quality, Development Processes, CI/CD, DevOps, Automation, etc.

I believe in tech and programming as a way to improve people lives. Tech isolated from the "real world" doesnt make much sense to me.

## :briefcase: What I do

Currently, I work as Backend Engineer at [JumiaPay](https://pay.jumia.com.ng). My work is mostly developing APIs for the JumiaPay "Business Area" as well as general maintenance of the platform. The core stack is Golang and Java for the Backend, MySQL as Data store. Memcached and Couchbase for Caching.

Outside of work hours, I like to explore new things and do usefull stuff to improve my productivity and workflows. That´s why I have Open sourced more than 20 [Ulauncher Extensions](https://ext.ulauncher.io/), a Application Launcher for linux, including [ulauncher-github](https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-github), [ulauncher-brotab](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-brotab) and many more.

I have also built some extensions for VS Code, like [vscode-devhints](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brpaz.devhints), GitHub Acctions for [Hadolint](https://github.com/brpaz/hadolint-action) and [Container Structure Tests](https://github.com/brpaz/structure-tests-action) and other small Linux Apps like [notion-menubar](https://github.com/brpaz/notion-menubar).

Building these tools, not only allow me building something useful that I personally use, but also work with some other technologies like Python and Typescript.

In middle term, I plan to deep dive on Kubernetes and GitOps and also building a SaaS from "idea to production". Still tryiing to find a good idea tough. ;)

I also like writting about my discoveries and tech in general. You can find my articles on [Dev](https://dev.to/brpaz).
