## 👋 Hello!

My name is Bruuno Paz, and I am a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. 🇵🇹

I am eager to learn new things and I have a deep interest in everything related to the Software Devlopment Lifecycle like Engineering practices, Software Quality, CI/CD, DevOps and Automation.

The technologies I am mostly familiar with are **PHP** (with **Symfony** framework) and **Golang**. Also have working experience with Java and personal interest in NodeJS and Typescript. I believe in using whatever tech stack is more appropriate to get the job done.

I strongly believe in tech and programming as a way to improve people lives and that´s my main focus.
